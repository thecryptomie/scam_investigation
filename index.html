								<h2>Background</h2>
							</header>

							<p>It was brought to the attention of the Algorillas community that there was an impersonator lurking in our discord. The scammer was impersonating the manager of Algorillas and started dming people about opportunities to buy APEs. A member of the community unfortunately fell victim to this scam and sent 700A in exchange for two APEs. As a community driven discord, we took it upon ourselves to conduct an investigation to identify the scammer and prevent future issues. This website contains a summary of the findings from our investigation and we present them here for the community to see.

							<h3>The Purchase Transactions</h3>
							To purchase the APEs, DegenScientist sent two transactions amounting to 620A to a wallet separate from the wallet that minted the fake APEs. After these transaction were sent, the wallet that minted the fake APEs then sent the two fake APEs to DegenScientist</p>

							<p>Wallets involved are, SCKD, OE6C, and ORFH. The roles they play are described below.</p>

							<p> If you are at all familiar with how NFTs are typically bought and sold, you probably think that something seems off here. Why would you need to send money to a wallet that doesnt hold the NFT as payment for the NFT? In direct exchanges, you either use something like RandSwap to handle the direct sale or, if you personally know the person on the other end, you might just send the payment directly to their wallet. This oddity spurred a deeper look into what was going in and that is what we did.

							<h2>The Deep Dive</h2>
						</header>
						<p>This is where things get interesting. To establish relationships between wallets, we wrote some code to help sort things out; given any two wallets it will compile their entire transaction history and search for any wallets that they have both interacted, a common wallet. This common wallet serves as a link between the two wallets. For example, if it were the creator address for an NFT project like MNGO, this would tell us that these two wallets both probably own a MNGO or at the very least opted-in to a MNGO NFT. </p>

						<p> By analyzing the transaction histories, we were able to identify a list of wallets that paint a clearer picture of what happened.

So three separate individuals are using the same wallet to transfer funds to an exchange. Weird, right? </li>

							<h2>Summary</h2>
						</header>
					<p>7 days ago, the SCKD wallet began minting fake APEs with the intention of taking advantage of the community excitement around the highly anticipated release of the APEs. 7 days ago, the SCKD wallet sent two Elites to FZP4 (Dongabes) and then another one this morning (March 3rd). This morning (March 3rd), Discord user DegenScientist stated that they had been scammed and spent 700A by purchasing two fake APEs. In reality, they were scammed for 620A, not 700A. Furthermore, 7 days ago FZP4 (Dongabes wallet) sent exactly 700A to TXD2 (the wallet funded by TinyApe, a project created by DegenScientist). Upon receiving the 700A 7 days ago, it was then sent immediately to OE6C (the wallet where the "scammed" funds were sent). Upon receiving the 700A, OE6C sent that money right back to an exchange wallet. Finally, the TXD2 wallet (funded by DegenScientist) sent an additional 350A to the OE6C wallet this morning. Those 350A were funded by a 350A transaction from FZP4 (Dongabes) and they were immediately sent to an exchange wallet. <b>The connections between all of these wallets are undeniable and irrefutable; the transaction history does not lie. On behalf of the entire Algorilla's Community, we demand answers to explain this precarious scenario in hopes of shedding more light on an unfortunate situation.</b>
